# Mastermind Game - Python

Mastermind is a popular logic game where a player or the computer tries to guess a hidden sequence of numbers. This project implements two gameplay modes:

- **Automatic Gameplay**: the computer tries to guess the hidden sequence using a minimax algorithm.  
- **Player Gameplay**: the player tries to guess a hidden sequence randomly generated by the program.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main files:

### 1. `main.py`
The main entry point of the program. Handles the selection of the gameplay mode:  
- **Automatic mode** (computer guesses the sequence).  
- **Player mode** (player guesses the sequence).

### 2. `ai_gameplay.py`
Module handling the gameplay where the computer guesses the hidden sequence.

Key functions:  
- Generating the first guess.  
- Checking the correctness of guesses.  
- Minimax algorithm to select the best move.

### 3. `player_gameplay.py`
Module handling the gameplay where the player guesses the hidden sequence.

Key functions:  
- Generating the hidden sequence.  
- Handling the player's guesses.

### 4. `judge.py`
Module responsible for checking the correctness of guesses.

Key function:  
- Compare the hidden sequence with the guessed sequence.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Requirements:**  
   - Python 3.9 or higher.

2. **Run the game:**  
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd Mastermind
     python3 main.py
     ```
   - Select the gameplay mode:
     - `1` – Automatic Gameplay (computer guesses the sequence)  
     - `2` – Player Gameplay (player guesses the sequence)
